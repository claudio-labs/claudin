/**
 * CLAUDE.md content delta — emit only when the project/user memory
 * file content changes between turns, not every turn.
 *
 * WHY: `prependUserContext` in `src/utils/api.ts` renders the CLAUDE.md
 * contents as a `<system-reminder>` user message on EVERY API call
 * (per turn AND per tool-use cycle within a turn). The memoized source
 * (`getUserContext` in `src/context.ts`) returns a stable string across
 * calls, so Anthropic/Bedrock/Vertex prompt caching covers it, but:
 *   - OpenAI / Kimi / DeepSeek / Codex use **implicit prefix caching**
 *     which benefits from byte-identical prefixes; spurious re-emission
 *     still costs one round-trip of bytes uploaded.
 *   - GitHub Copilot has no cache — each byte is billed once.
 *   - Ollama reuses its local KV cache only when the prefix is stable.
 *
 * Mirrors the pattern of:
 *   - `src/utils/mcpInstructionsDelta.ts`
 *   - `src/utils/toolSearch.ts` (`getDeferredToolsDelta`)
 *   - `src/utils/attachments.ts` (`getAgentListingDeltaAttachment`)
 *
 * Each scanner reconstructs the "announced state" by walking prior
 * attachments of the same type, compares against the current state,
 * and emits only the diff. Session history is the source of truth;
 * no external mutable state is required.
 *
 * Copy elision: returns `null` when nothing changed so the caller can
 * avoid re-emitting an attachment at all (the delta pattern's central
 * idea — the content lives in the transcript once, not N times).
